# ResumeScanner
Alpha resume scanner that takes copy and paste versions of your resume and targeted job description

Pseudo resume scanner that works by copying and pasting your resume into the java compiler as input, and then the program filters out common words and symbols like “the”, and”, “like”, “if”, etc. Then paste the job description and it counts the key words that match, giving you an overall percentage of how much your resume matches to the job description
